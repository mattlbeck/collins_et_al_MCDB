This data directory contains pre-made formatted output files
from prediction programs miRCat, miRDeep, and mapmi. The raw output
data has not been provided due to the size of the data. Instead, the
scripts used on the raw output data to create the provided files
have been provided.

For miRCat and miRDeep, the tools were run in batch for each sample
fasta file, and the results were output to one directory per run. The
directory names are used as input to each of the formatting scripts.
